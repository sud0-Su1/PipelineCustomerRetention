#  Enterprise-Scale Customer Retention Analytics & Prediction Pipeline  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Telecom companies face significant revenue losses due to **customer churn**. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project develops an **end-to-end enterprise pipeline** for predicting customer churn and generating actionable retention insights.  

The solution leverages **Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, MLflow, and Power BI** to build a **scalable data + ML ecosystem**, enabling advanced analytics and predictive modeling.

## 🛠️ Approach  

### 1. **Data Pipeline**  
- Built scalable ingestion pipelines with **Databricks + PySpark**.  
- Handled structured/unstructured telecom data (customer profiles, usage, billing).  
- Stored curated datasets in **Delta Lake** for reliability and scalability.  

### 2. **Feature Engineering & Modeling**  
- Derived key churn indicators: tenure, monthly charges, contract type, service usage.  
- Trained multiple models:  
  - ✅ **XGBoost** → Best accuracy & interpretability  
  - ✅ **Random Forest** → Robust baseline  
  - ✅ **Logistic Regression** → Lightweight benchmark  

### 3. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**  
- Logged parameters, metrics, and models.  
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning** with MLflow experiments.  
- Registered best models for deployment.  

### 4. **Deployment**  
- Integrated best model into **Databricks jobs** for batch inference.  
- Stored churn predictions back in **Delta tables** for reporting.  

### 5. **Visualization (Power BI)**  
- Built dashboards highlighting:  
  - 📉 Churn rates by **demographics**  
  - 📊 Churn by **plan type & contract**  
  - 🔍 Usage pattern analysis  
  - 🎯 Customer segments at high churn risk

## 📈 Results  
- **Model Performance:**  
  - XGBoost achieved the highest predictive accuracy with strong precision/recall trade-off.  
  - Random Forest provided reliable results with explainability.  

- **Business Impact:**  
  - Enabled **proactive retention campaigns**.  
  - Identified high-risk customers across age groups, plan types, and service usage patterns.  
  - Delivered **interactive dashboards** for leadership decision-making.
